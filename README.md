# Diffusion-Weights-Generation
Replication an approach for generating neural network weights described in this paper: "Diffusion-Based Neural Network Weights Generation" <br />
Working on VAE weights encoding. <br />
Adopted code from the [DNNWG](https://github.com/sorobedio/DNNWG) repository. <br />
The dataset used - [ModelZooDataset](https://github.com/ModelZoos/ModelZooDataset):
- MNIST
- SVHN
- CIFAR-10
- STL-10
